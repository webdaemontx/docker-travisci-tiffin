# Installation

Acquia Purge has been designed from the ground up to be extremely simple and
almost failsafe to use. The module provides the _means_ to purge all load
balancers on Acquia Cloud and focuses on doing that well, where the Expire
module remains responsible for telling what needs to be purged. Setting up both
modules shouldn't take long:

1. Ensure you are not running incompatible modules like purge, varnish or boost.

2. Download expire and acquia_purge into your site.
   e.g.: ``drush dl expire acquia_purge``

3. Enable both modules.
   e.g.: ``drush en expire acquia_purge``

4. Assign the ``purge on-screen`` permission to editor roles to give them a
   visually indicative progress bar upon saving content. Purges still happen
   without this permission on the background (triggered via AJAX).

5. It's highly recommended to visit the status report page or to run
   ``drush ap-diagnosis``, in which Acquia Purge will perform diagnostic tests.

questions in the ``FAQ.md`` file or file a issue on Drupal.org.

### Tuning

By strict design and principle, this module doesn't have any UI exposed settings
or configuration forms. The reason behind this philosophy is that - as a pure -
utility module only site administrators should be able to change anything and if
they do, things should be traceable in ``settings.php``. Although Acquia Purge
attempts to stay as turnkey and zeroconf as possible, the following options
exist as of this version and documented below:
